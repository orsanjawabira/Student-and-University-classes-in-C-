 C++ implementation modeling a university system with Student and University classes. Student manages individual data (ID, GPA), and University aggregates students for GPA statistics. Includes methods for data manipulation and aggregation.
To get the inputs to not repeat when you enter them you will want to comment out test 2 so it takes the inputs and provides the output.
